            <h2>Biography</h2>
            
            <p>I was born on February 26th, 1998 in Morristown, New Jersey. My entire life up until college I have lived in a small town called Haledon, also in New Jersey.
                I've been enrolled in private catholic school from 3rd-12th grade, so the sensation of being in an all-guys highschool prepared me for the lacking female
                population here at Stevens. During high school, I was very involved in my studies, videogames, and varsity crew (the sport where you row a boat and a short
                person yells at you.) 
            </p>
            <p>
                Here at Stevens, I'm currently a 3/4 Computer Science major, with my main involvement being the Student Government Association (SGA). Since freshman year I've been
                a voice for the student body on vocalizing issues we have with the campus, staff, and other students in order to make a better experience here at Stevens.
                I'm currently a new member for a fraternity and I'm very excited to expand my horizons with new connections and expriences this semester.
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduation I would like to land a high-paying yet engaging and exciting job in my field. Also party my ass off in my twenties.
            </p>
